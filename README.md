Send to Receive
===============

Send to Receive is a WebGL particle animation that responds to SMS. It uses text messages to generate pseudo-random combinations of particle colour, background colour, size and speed to change the animation. It also uses a [dictionary of colour words]('http://xkcd.com/color/rgb.txt') found via [XKCD]('http://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/') to find matching words in the text messages and use them to colour the particles.

[You can see it running live here]('severe-earth-129.herokuapp.com') (you'll need a WebGL capable browser such as [Chrome]('http://www.google.com/chrome/')).

The animation is based on a [THREE.js]('https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/') demo [project]('http://aerotwist.com/lab/creating-particles-with-three-js/') by [Paul Lewis / @aerotwist]('http://aerotwist.com/').

Send to Receive was created over two days at [The Creators Project]('http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/') / [Eyebeam]('http://eyebeam.org/') #arthack hackathon. Read more about [the other arthack projects and winners here]('http://www.thecreatorsproject.com/blog/meet-the-winners-of-art-hack-weekend').
